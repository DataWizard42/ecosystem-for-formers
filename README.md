## Project Structure

### Frontend
The mobile app is built using **React Native** to provide a cross-platform solution.
- **UI Components**: Uses React Native Paper or NativeBase for clean, responsive user interfaces.
- **State Management**: Utilizes Redux or Context API for efficient state handling across the app.
- **Navigation**: Manages multiple screens using React Navigation.

### Backend
The server-side of the application is built using **Node.js** and **Express**.
- **API Development**: RESTful APIs built to handle various operations such as inventory management, order processing, and market access.
- **Database**:
  - **PostgreSQL**: Used for structured data such as user information, orders, and inventory.
  - **MongoDB**: Used for unstructured data like logs and weather patterns.

### AI/ML
- **Time Series Forecasting Models**: Predicts crop demand and resource needs using models like **LSTM** and **ARIMA**.
- **TensorFlow.js**: For AI/ML model inference within the app.
- **Google Cloud AI Platform**: Hosts the AI/ML models for predictive analytics.

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Manages the entire infrastructure for the backend, AI/ML models, and storage.
- **AWS S3/Google Cloud Storage**: Stores files, images, and reports for the ecosystem.
- **JWT Authentication**: Ensures secure access to the platform using JSON Web Tokens.
